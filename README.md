# Snake-Water-Gun Game

This is Snake-Water-Gun game developed in Python language.

Snake Water Gun is a simple game played between two players, typically referred to as Player A and Player B. The game is also known by different names, such as Rock Paper Scissors. In this game, each player chooses one of three options: snake, water, or gun.

The outcome of the game is determined by the rules:

Snake beats Water: Snake drinks water, so Player A wins.
Water beats Gun: Gun gets wet, so Player A wins.
Gun beats Snake: Gun kills the snake, so Player B wins.
If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.

I have used the concepts such as randomisation, condition statements and functions in this program.
